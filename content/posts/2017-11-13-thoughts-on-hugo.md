I've been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a couple of days now, converted this site from Jekyll to Hugo. The learning curve is fairly steep coming from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but that's precisely because of the flexibility of the platform.

The real beauty of Hugo, compared to Jekyll, is how much your content and your git repo are separated from any theme you might utilize. In Hugo, themes are cloned in as submodules. There is a system for overriding theme templates and content. And you never have to fork someone else's github repo or deal with a messy git merge from an upstream repo. This has always driven me nuts about Jekyll themes, especially when compared to the modularity of the Moodle themes and plugins I'm used to working with. Once you select a theme and start adding content, short of manually copying over all of your post files and other pages every time you switch themes (hours of work), you're stuck with not only that theme but that repo (and whatever build processes&mdash;grunt, gulp, guzzle&mdash;you've inherited from the theme developer). Hugo is in this regard much more forward-looking. As I said, the learning curve is steep. Take my advice and watch the videos that go along with their documentation pages.
