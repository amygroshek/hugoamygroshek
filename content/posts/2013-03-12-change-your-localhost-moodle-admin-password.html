<p>Basic instructions for when you happen to lose the admin password for your localhost Moodle site (or have ssh access to a live site and, God forbid, have lost *that* admin password. There <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Administration_via_command_line#Reset_user_password">are instructions</a>Â for this in the Moodle docs. But here is a bit more detail.</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">cd moodleroot // cd to wherever your install is at :)
php admin/cli/reset_password.php // Run change pw script with PHP
== Password reset == 
enter username (manual authentication only)
: admin
Enter new password
: **********
Password changed</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
