<p>You've been working on the same issue for a month, rebasing revisions back into the first commit. Now the date on the commit is from a month ago, and does not reflect when you last worked on it. This command will update the date of the commit:</p>
<pre class="font:monospace line-height:30 top-margin:24 bottom-margin:24 lang:default decode:true">git commit --amend --date="$(date -R)"</pre>
<p>It will then run you through the whole commit workflow. Don't be thrown: don't make any other changes, or get nervous that you haven't. Just run though the steps, exit your editor, and run the old `git log` to see the shiny new date.</p>
