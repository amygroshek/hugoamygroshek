title: Vagrant NFS Export File Invalid

<p>I occasionally run into the following error when trying to <code>vagrant up</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">
NFS is reporting that your exports file is invalid. Vagrant does
this check before making any changes to the file. Please correct
the issues below and execute "vagrant reload":

exports:2: path contains non-directory or non-existent components: /Users/macpro/code/wip-HOSSUP-3518
exports:2: no usable directories in export entry
exports:2: using fallback (marked offline): /</pre>
<p>I've been able to replicate the error by deleting a VM from my development directory. It seems that Vagrant must verify your <code>/etc/exports</code> file against your available VMs when running any <code>vagrant up</code>. If you routinely clone and delete VMs, you'll probably run into this issue. </p>
<p>Last week I documented a workaround on <a title="View workaround on stack overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/21194926/590107">Stackoverflow</a>. But it looks like it might be even simpler:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">vagrant halt // Yes, the VM is running, despite death rattle featured above.
rm -rf /etc/exports // Remove the exports file. 
vagrant up
</pre>
<p>Be sure to halt before attempting this. <code>vagrant reload</code> will not work. Vagrant recreates <code>/etc/exports</code> on the next <code>vagrant up</code>. </p>
