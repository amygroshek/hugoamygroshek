<div id="eob_target"></div>


The electronic poem above is a combination of randomized lines. Some of them I wrote myself. Other lines come from my health insurance documents, Douglas Crockford's _Javascript: The Good Parts_, and other sources.

How does it work?

1. JavaScript loaded by the theme detects a specially identified container on the page.
2. A JavaScript function is called. This function repeats a loop in which it selects a random line from an array and inserts that line into the special container on the page.
3. Ever 10 iterations the function inserts a supplementary invitation to the reader to provide private information to social networking services.
4. After 30 iterations, iteration stops and citations are inserted.
5. This poem is different every time you load the page. Each instance is ephemeral. Sometimes certain lines never make it into the poem.
