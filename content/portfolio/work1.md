In 2013 Andrew Slattery was awarded the The Max Harris National Poetry Award. You can still see [his poem, "Grandmother Going Gone"](http://www.unisa.edu.au/PageFiles/37321/MHA%20poems.pdf "PDF"), along with those of  those of other contest winners from that year, on the University of South Australia web site. Slattery's poem contains lines from Sylvia Plath and Seamus Heaney. And from my poem, "Single Life 18," which was published in an online journal, [Contrary Magazine](http://contrarymagazine.com/2011/single-life-18/), in 2011.

My lines:

> Every spring, in this city, another woman, not
> beautiful, not advantageously educated or employed,
> crouches on the 16 square feet of concrete
> outside the patio doors of her studio apartment,
> to plant mint and basil in the pot opposite the pot  
> of marigolds which the rabbits do not eat.

My lines in "Grandma Going Gone":

> Mint and basil in 
> the pot opposite the pot of marigolds which the rabbits do not eat.

A philosopher in Canberra named Anthony Hayes (no, not the actor) discovered my poem by Google searching lines of Slattery's poem. [And blogged about it](https://thesinisterquarter.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/plagiarism-for-all-not-just-boring-poets/). No one bothered to tell me. I found Hayes's blog post in 2014 while doing a random Google search of my name. 

I am serving the [PDF with this awful poem](../../static/img/MHA-poems.pdf) from my domain as well, so that no one can ever get rid of it. And if anyone is sick enough to come after me with copyright infringement, they'd better have a brilliant story about their sick sense of humor.

And, in addition, I am going to animate the lines of Slattery's plagiarized poem. To permanently dissolve those garish line breaks, to restore some the intensity, interest, and agency of the lines of the great and unknown poets who butressed Slattery's claim to national repute. For the record, I am no Seamus Heaney. I am still struggling to publish. I am queer, crip, and working class. I cannot apply for fellowships or residencies because I have a chronic illness and in the United States the only way to get health insurance with a pre-existing condition is to work full time. So I have spent the last 10 years (in which, at some point, Slattery lifted those lines from my poem) working jobs and losing time. I am not, oh no, I am not going to address Slattery, and I'm not going to call him a poet. But for the rest of you: this is what you do with found things. You transform them. You make them a brilliant, fresh, new composition. Something unmistakable. Something which puts the petty theft of plagiarism to shame. The `iframe` container is not responsive.
